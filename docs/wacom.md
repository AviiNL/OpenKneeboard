# Using Wacom Tablets with OpenKneeboard

It's easiest to set all of these settings to 'All applications'; otherwise (for example, if you use your
drawing tablet for drawing :p) you'll need to apply these settings both to the OpenKneeboard app, and to
every game you want to use the tablet with. For example, you may need to create a Wacom profile for both
OpenKneeboard and DCS World.

To use the pen for drawing or UIs (e.g. PDF table of contents), you need the
following settings:

![set tip to click; both other buttons 'application defined'](screenshots/wacom-pen-settings.png)

If an on-pen button is being held while drawing, the pen will act as an eraser.

If you also want to use the on-tablet 'Express Keys' to change page/tabs, you'll
also need these settings:

![all expresskeys to 'application defined', disable 'expressview'](screenshots/wacom-tablet-settings.png)

You can then assign the buttons to actions in Edit -> Settings in the app:
