## Getting Help

First, [check the troubleshooting guides](troubleshooting/).

I make this for my own use, and I share this in the hope others find it useful; I'm not able to commit to support, bug fixes, or feature development.

Support may be available from the community via:

- [Discord](https://go.openkneeboard.com/discord)
- [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/OpenKneeboard/OpenKneeboard/discussions)

I am not able to respond to 1:1 requests for help via any means, including GitHub, Discord, Twitter, Reddit, or email.
