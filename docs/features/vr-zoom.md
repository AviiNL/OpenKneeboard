# VR Zoom

By default, OpenKneeboard will make a kneeboard larger when you are looking at it; you can:

- change how much larger it is in Settings -> VR
- disable gaze-based zoom entirely in Settings -> VR
- change how close to the center of the kneeboard you need to be looking in Settings -> VR -> Gaze Target Size; the default is anywhere on the page. You might want to make this larger to make it easier to zoom, or smaller to avoid accidentally triggering it when looking around the cockpit
- use an input binding to toggle zoom
- use a [remote control](./remote-controls.md) to toggle zoom, e.g. with a [StreamDeck](./streamdeck.md) or [VoiceAttack](./voice-attack.md)
