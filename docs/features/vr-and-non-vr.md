# VR and non-VR

OpenKneeboard has *optional* VR support; it supports the majority of consumer headsets.

For details, see [game compatibility](../compatibility/games.md)

## VR

OpenKneeboard will appear 'on your knee'. If it's in the wrong place, start by recentering instead of adjusting the position - it's useful to bind recentering OpenKneeboard to the same button/combination you use for recentering in-game.

You can add a recentering binding in OpenKneeboard Settings -> Input, or adjust the position in Settings -> VR.

If you fly with different aircraft or games, or switch between positions for another reason, you might want to use a different [profile](./profiles.md) for each game.

## Non-VR

OpenKneeboard will appear in a fixed position in the game window; you can adjust the position in OpenKneeboard Settings -> Non VR. OpenKneeboard does not support an 'in-world' kneeboard position outside of VR, and this is unlikely to be added in the future.

You can hide/show OpenKneeboard with a 'toggle visibility' binding in OpenKneeboard -> Settings -> Input, or toggle, hide, or show with the [remote controls](./remote-controls.md), e.g. via a [StreamDeck](./streamdeck.md) or [VoiceAttack](./voice-attack.md).
