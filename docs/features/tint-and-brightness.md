# Tint and Brightness

**This feature will be available in v1.4**

By default, OpenKneeboard uses a 'full white' tint; this is equivalent to full brightness. Other settings might be preferable for nighttime.

Tint is just a more general brightness control - a 50% gray tint is equivalent to 50% brightness - however brightness can be adjusted for any color.

## Enabling brightness/tint

Enable brightness/tint control in OpenKneeboard Settings -> Advanced

## Configuring brightness/tint

Tint color can be adjusted in Settings -> Advanced, and it can be disabled to restore 'full white'; you can also increase or decrease brightness or toggle tint with:

- bindings in OpenKneeboard Settings -> Input
- [remote controls](./remote-controls.md), e.g. with a [StreamDeck](./streamdeck.md) or [VoiceAttack](./voice-attack.md)
