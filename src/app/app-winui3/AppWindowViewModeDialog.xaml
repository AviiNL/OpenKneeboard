      What do you want to happen when you change tab or page in the
      OpenKneeboard app window?
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph Margin="0,8">
      <Run FontWeight="Bold">Kneeboard mode:</Run>
      Changing tabs or pages in the app window will also change the current
      tab or page in the in-game view you looked at most recently. 
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph Margin="0,8">
      You probably want this if you have tabs with multiple pages, or have
      more tabs than views. If you're unsure, pick this if you're using
      OpenKneeboard with flight simulators.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph Margin="0,8">
      <Run FontWeight="Bold">Overlay mode:</Run>
      Changing tabs or pages in the app window will not change which tab
      or page is shown in-game.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph Margin="0,8">
      You probably want to use this if you have the same number of tabs as
      views, and each tab has one page; this is usually what you want if
      you're using OpenKneeboard for overlays rather than as a kneeboard,
      such as when sim racing.
