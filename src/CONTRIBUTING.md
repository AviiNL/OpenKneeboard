# Contributing

For code contributions, please look over [docs/internals/](docs/internals/)

All new contributors will be required to agree to a non-exclusive Contributor License Agreement via https://cla-assistant.io/fredemmott/OpenKneeboard as the current license may be too restrictive for future development. The Contributor License Agreement gives me the ability to relicense OpenKneeboard in the future, for example:

* to use libraries that is not compatible with the current license, e.g. WinUI3 (as of Feburary 2022) or GhostScript (potentially improving PDF support)
* to use artwork that is not compatible with the current license, e.g. GlyphIcons

**IMPORTANT**: To avoid potential future issues, the CLA is not limited to circumstances like the above; it would, for example, also allow me to use any contributions in proprietary software.
