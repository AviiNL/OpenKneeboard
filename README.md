# OpenKneeboard

OpenKneeboard is an open source Kneeboard application, primarily aimed at virtual reality flight simulators, such as DCS World.

## Current Status

OpenKneeboard is relatively new, and not yet widely tested; consider it 'early access' :p

## WARNING: Anti-Cheat

While OpenKneeboard is not a cheat, it does hook into the games rendering and input pipelines, which over-eager anti-cheat systems may consider ban-worthy. While this is similar to how other overlays work (e.g. Steam and Discord), it is possible that using OpenKneeboard may lead to an anti-cheat ban.

Note that OpenKneeboard has **NO WARRANTY**; see [the LICENSE file](LICENSE) and [full text of the GPLv2](gpl-2.0.txt) for details.

## Getting Help

I make this for my own use, and I share this in the hope others find it useful; I'm not able to commit to support, bug fixes, or feature development.

Support may be available from the community via:

- [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/fredemmott/OpenKneeboard/discussions)
- [Discord](https://discord.gg/CWrvKfuff3)

I am not able to respond to 1:1 requests for help via any means, including GitHub, Discord, Twitter, Reddit, or email.

## Requirements

- 64-bit Windows 10, Fall Creators Update (version 1709 or 10.0.16299) or newer
- A graphics card that supports Direct3D 11

Windows 11 is untested, and I am unable to investigate any issues reported with OpenKneeboard on Windows 11.

## Getting Started

1. Download [the latest release](https://github.com/fredemmott/OpenKneeboard/releases/latest)
2. Install it; the installer will offer to launch OpenKneeboard when finished.
3. Install the DCS hooks if prompted
4. Open settings
5. Add DCS to the 'Games' tab if it was not automatically added
6. Configure your bindings
7. Add any other games and set up your tabs how you like them

The hooks are optional, but are required for the DCS-specific tabs to work. If your DCS 'Saved Games' is not either `Saved Games\DCS` or `Saved Games\DCS.openbeta`, download the `.zip` file as well, and copy `OpenKneeboardDCSExt.lua` and `OpenKneeboardDCSExt.dll` from the `bin` subfolder of that zip to `YOUR_DCS_SAVEDGAMES_DIRECTORY\Scripts\Hooks` - if it doesn't already exist, create that folder first.

## Features

### Graphics Tablet Support

Wintab-compatible graphics tablets are optionally supported; OpenKneeboard has been tested with Wacom Intuos S and Huion H640P tablets.

* [Huion instructions](docs/huion.md)
* [Wacom instructions](docs/wacom.md)

Write down 9-lines, do quick sketches, and use PDF bookmarks/tables of contents.

### DirectInput Joystick and Keyboard Support

Bind any of your device buttons (even if you have 128) to show/hide the kneeboard, previous tab, next tab, previous page, or next page.

### Attach to running games

Fits with your flow; no need to launch the games via OpenKneeboard, or to start OpenKneeboard first.

### VR? Non-VR? Either works.

### VR Zoom

Don't cloud your cockpit: goes out of the way when you're not looking at it.

### PDF Files

Add any PDF to your kneeboard:

### PDF Navigation

If you have a wintab-compatible tablet, quickly jump to the page you want:

If a PDF file contains bookmarks (often shown as a table of contents in the sidebar, you can jump to sections by clicking the 'Navigation' button in OpenKneeboard, or the 'menu' icon shown in-game with your graphics tablet pen.

Internals links in PDFs (e.g. in the table of contents in the first few pages) can also be 'clicked' with a graphics tablet pen.

### DCS Radio Log

A log of all radio messages that are shown by DCS World as text in the top left corner - there is no transcription. This is very useful for single player campaigns and close air support.

### Categorized DCS Kneeboard

Quickly jump between sections:

#### Mission Tab

#### Aircraft Tab

#### Theater Tab

Field info etc

I believe these are currently only provided for the Caucasus and NTTR theaters.

### Not *just* for DCS

You can also add any other folder of images as another tab; this works great in DCS, or in other games.

## Supported Games

- Non-VR: DirectX 11
- OpenVR: any
- Oculus: DirectX 11, DirectX 12.

I hope to expand this list in the future, especially for OpenXR.

OpenKneeboard has been primarily tested with DCS: World Open Beta via the Oculus SDK, using DirectX 11.
