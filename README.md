# OpenKneeboard

OpenKneeboard is an open source Kneeboard application, primarily aimed at virtual reality flight simulators, such as DCS World.

## Current Status

This is best thought of as a 'developer preview': it works for me, on my computer, but has not been significantly used by others. The settings UI and documentation are particularly lacking at present.

If you are not a C++ developer, you may want to use [VRK](https://forums.eagle.ru/topic/211308-vrk-a-virtual-reality-enabled-kneeboard-with-touch-and-ink-support) instead.

## WARNING: Anti-Cheat

While OpenKneeboard is not a cheat, it does hook into the games rendering pipeline, which over-eager anti-cheat systems may consider suspicious. While this is similar to how other overlays work (e.g. Steam and Discord), it is possible that using OpenKneeboard may lead to an anti-cheat ban.

Note that OpenKneeboard has **NO WARRANTY**; see [the LICENSE file](LICENSE) and [full text of the GPLv2](gpl-2.0.txt) for details.

## Getting Help

I make this for my own use, and I share this in the hope others find it useful; I'm not able to commit to support, bug fixes, or feature development.

Support may be available from the community via:

- [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/fredemmott/OpenKneeboard/discussions)
- [Discord](https://discord.gg/CWrvKfuff3)

I am not able to respond to 1:1 requests for help via any means, including GitHub, Discord, Twitter, Reddit, or email.

## Requirements

- Up-to-date 64-bit Windows 10
- A graphics card that supports Direct3D 11

Windows 11 is untested, and I am unable to investigate any issues reported with OpenKneeboard on Windows 11.

## Features

### DirectInput Control

Bind any of your device buttons (even if you have 128) to show/hide the kneeboard, previous tab, next tab, previous page, or next page.

### Attach to running games

Fits with your flow; no need to launch the games via OpenKneeboard, or to start OpenKneeboard first.

### VR? Non-VR? Either works.

### VR Zoom

Don't cloud your cockpit: goes out of the way when you're not looking at it.

### DCS Radio Log

A log of all radio messages that are shown by DCS World as text in the top left corner - there is no transcription. This is very useful for single player campaigns.

#### Aircraft Tab

#### Theater Tab

Field info etc

I believe these are currently only provided for the Caucasus and NTTR theaters.

### Not *just* for DCS

You can also add any other folder of images as another tab; this works great in DCS, or in other games.

## Supported Games

- Non-VR: DirectX 11
- OpenVR: any
- Oculus: DirectX 11, DirectX 12.

I hope to expand this list in the future, especially for OpenXR.

OpenKneeboard has been primarily tested with DCS: World via the Oculus SDK, using DirectX 11.
