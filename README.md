# OpenKneeboard

OpenKneeboard is an open source Kneeboard application, primarily aimed at virtual reality flight simulators, such as DCS World.

## Current Status

This is best thought of as a 'developer preview': it works for me, on my computer, but has not been significantly used by others. The settings UI and documentation are particularly lacking at present.

If you are not a C++ developer, you may want to use [VRK](https://forums.eagle.ru/topic/211308-vrk-a-virtual-reality-enabled-kneeboard-with-touch-and-ink-support) instead.

## WARNING: Anti-Cheat

While OpenKneeboard is not a cheat, it does hook into the games rendering pipeline, which over-eager anti-cheat systems may consider suspicious. While this is similar to how other overlays work (e.g. Steam and Discord), it is possible that using OpenKneeboard may lead to an anti-cheat ban.

Note that OpenKneeboard has **NO WARRANTY**; see [the LICENSE file](LICENSE) and [full text of the GPLv2](gpl-2.0.txt) for details.

## Getting Help

I make this for my own use, and I share this in the hope others find it useful; I'm not able to commit to support, bug fixes, or feature development.

Support may be available from the community via:

- [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/fredemmott/OpenKneeboard/discussions)
- [Discord](https://discord.gg/CWrvKfuff3)

I am not able to respond to 1:1 requests for help via any means, including GitHub, Discord, Twitter, Reddit, or email.

## Requirements

- Up-to-date 64-bit Windows 10
- A graphics card that supports Direct3D 11

Windows 11 is untested, and I am unable to investigate any issues reported with OpenKneeboard on Windows 11.

## Supported Games

- Non-VR: DirectX 11
- OpenVR: any
- Oculus: DirectX 11, DirectX 12.

I hope to expand this list in the future, especially for OpenXR.

OpenKneeboard has been primarily tested with DCS: World via the Oculus SDK, using DirectX 11.

## Features

- DirectInput control: previous/next tab/page. Up to 128 buttons are supported ;)
- Attach to running games; no need to launch the games via OpenKneeboard, or to start OpenKneeboard first.
- Folder Tab: shows images from a folder. Recommended 3:4 aspect ratio
- DCS Radio Log Tab: log of all radio messages that are shown by DCS World as text in the top left corner. There is no voice transcription. This is especially useful for single player campaigns.
- DCS Mission Tab: any mission-specific kneeboard pages.
- DCS Aircraft Tab: any aircraft-specific kneeboard pages.
- DCS Terrain Tab: any terrain-specific kneeboard pages. I believe these are currently only available for Caucasus and Nevada
